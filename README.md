## 🧩 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Excel — Data Review & Structure Understanding  
- Reviewed and validated dataset columns and formats.  
- Checked for missing values, outliers, and overall data structure.  
- Identified 37% booking cancellations and noted missing `Review Rating` and country entries.  

---

### 2️⃣ Python — EDA, Cleaning & Visualization  
Performed complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python using `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.  

#### 🔹 Key Data Cleaning Steps  
- Handled missing values using median imputation and conditional replacement.  
- Standardized column names for readability.  
- Removed irrelevant and redundant fields.  
- Created new calculated fields for better time-based and cancellation analysis.  

#### 🔹 Exploratory Insights  
- Visualized **booking and cancellation rates** by hotel type and month.  
- Analyzed **lead time** vs **cancellation probability**.  
- Compared **average daily rate (ADR)** between resort and city hotels.  
- Explored **market segments**, **booking sources**, and **country-wise reservations**.  

#### 📊 Sample Findings  
- **City hotels** have more bookings than resort hotels but similar cancellation ratios.  
- **August** had the highest booking volume, while **January** had the most cancellations.  
- **Higher prices (ADR)** directly correlate with **higher cancellation rates**.  
- **Portugal (PRT)** recorded the highest number of cancellations.  
- Most bookings came from **online travel agencies (46%)**, followed by **group bookings (27%)**.

### 3️⃣ Visualization Highlights  
- 📉 Bar Chart → Cancellation vs Non-cancellation rates.  
- 📈 Line Chart → ADR comparison across months.  
- 📊 Grouped Bar Chart → Reservation status by month.  
- 🌍 Map → Cancellations by country.  
- 🧮 Correlation Matrix → Relationship between price, waiting list, and cancellation rate.  

---

### 4️⃣ Reporting — ChatGPT & Word Integration  
- Used **ChatGPT** to generate insights, summarize analytical results, and refine the Python code.  
- Compiled results into a **detailed report (Word → PDF)** summarizing findings, graphs, and recommendations.  

---

### 5️⃣ Presentation — Gamma AI  
- Designed a **clean, modern presentation** using **Gamma AI** to visually communicate findings.  
- Focused on storytelling — showing the business problem, analytical process, insights, and final recommendations.  

---

## 📈 Key Findings  
- 📉 **Cancellation Rate:** 37.1% of all bookings.  
- 💰 **Higher prices (ADR)** lead to more cancellations.  
- 🏖️ **Resort hotels** have higher cancellation ratios than city hotels.  
- 📅 **August** is the busiest month; **January** sees the most cancellations.  
- 🌍 **Portugal (PRT)** is the top source of both bookings and cancellations.  
- 🌐 **46%** of customers booked through online travel agencies.
